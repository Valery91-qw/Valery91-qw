#### About: 
Hi, I'm a front-end developer. I began programming a few years ago and am now able to create web-apps that work on more than just my computer. 

I want to continue with the team to improve my skills and be useful for my future team. My strongest quality is that I'm always willing to learn new things and never give up. I'm looking forward to further dialogue.
